> If you don't have Homebrew installed, follow the steps at https://brew.sh/

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/Dev869/pulsewave-visual.git
cd pulsewave-visual
```

### 2. Create & Activate a Python Virtual Environment

source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Upgrade pip & Build Tools

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 4. Install System Dependencies (Homebrew)
```bash
# Install pkg-config & OpenCV & Tkinter
brew install pkg-config opencv tcl-tk
```

### 5. Install Python Requirements
```bash
# Install only the required PyPI packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Run the Streamlit App

> ```

### 7. Configuration & Troubleshooting
- If you encounter **OpenCV** import errors, confirm you have installed `opencv-python-headless` or built OpenCV via Homebrew.
- For any broken image-to-canvas issues, ensure `streamlit-drawable-canvas` is up to date and matches your Streamlit version.
- Permissions errors? Try:
  ```bash
  chmod +x pwv_app.py
  ```
- Customizing ports or base URL? Edit `~/.streamlit/config.toml`.
